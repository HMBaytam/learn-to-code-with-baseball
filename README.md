# Learn to Code with Baseball

## Back story
It has been a while since I wrote code in python (or any other language for that matter) to do some data analysis. While I was in a social media black hole I stumbled upon a book called Learn to Code with Baseball, and my curiousity was peeked.
Now the book is very very beginner friendly, and I have no knowledge what so ever about baseball, but I figured it would be nice to use this book to dust off my rusty python skills and get back in the game of data analysis
